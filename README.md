### Internship Assignment 1

#### Mehmet Yavuz Gunduz

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for an AI internship assignment. The main components of this notebook include:

1. **Print Statements**:
   - Displays the name "Mehmet Yavuz Gunduz_AI_Ass1".
   - Recites "Recite Darood e Pak".

2. **Passing Function**:
   - A function named `Passing_func` which determines if a student is eligible for a certificate based on their total marks.
   - The `total_marks` variable is set to 90.
   - If `total_marks` is less than 70, it prints "----> Oh No....!!!! You are disqualified".
   - If `total_marks` is 70 or higher, it prints "----> Yeah!!! You are eligible for certificate".

The structure of the notebook is as follows:

```python
print("Mehmet Yavuz Gunduz_AI_Ass1")
print("Recite Darood e Pak")

def Passing_func():
    total_marks = 90
    
    if total_marks < 70:
        print("----> Oh No....!!!! You are disqualified")
    else:
        print("----> Yeah!!! You are eligible for certificate")

Passing_func()
```

### How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it using Anaconda or pip:
   ```sh
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. **Open the Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. **Execute the Code**: Navigate to the location where you have saved the `internship_assigment1.ipynb` file, open it, and run the cells to see the output.

### Purpose

This notebook serves as a basic example of using print statements and a simple function in Python to demonstrate conditional statements and function calls.

Feel free to use and modify this code as needed.
